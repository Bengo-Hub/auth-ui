              <h3>6.1 Codevertex APIs</h3>
              <p>
                Access to our APIs (including the MarketFlow API, notifications API, and identity API) requires
                authentication via bearer tokens or API keys issued to your account. You are responsible for
                the security of your API credentials and for all API usage under your credentials.
              </p>
              <h3>6.2 Third-Party API Connections (Google Ads, Meta, etc.)</h3>
              <p>
                When you connect a third-party advertising or business platform to MarketFlow:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>You represent and warrant that you are the owner or authorised administrator of the connected account.</li>
                <li>You authorise us to make API calls to the connected platform on your behalf, only for the features described in the product and your selected integration settings.</li>
                <li>You acknowledge that your use of third-party APIs is also subject to those platforms&apos; own Terms of Service (e.g., <a href="https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-primary">Google Ads API Terms</a>).</li>
                <li>You may revoke any third-party integration at any time from your account settings; revocation takes effect immediately.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>6.3 Rate Limits &amp; Fair Use</h3>
              <p>
                API usage is subject to per-tenant rate limits and the quotas of the underlying third-party
                platform. Exceeding limits may result in temporary throttling or, for persistent abuse,
                suspension of API access. We do not guarantee third-party API availability or accuracy.
